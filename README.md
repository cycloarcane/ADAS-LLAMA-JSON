# ADAS-LLAMA-JSON

This repository is a fork of the [ADAS](https://github.com/ShengranHu/ADAS) repository, with additional scripts and modifications to generate JSON formatting for open-source models, including LLAMA.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to extend the capabilities of the original ADAS repository by allowing the outputs of open-source models to be formatted as JSON. This is particularly useful for integrating with other systems that require structured data formats.

## Features

- **JSON Output**: Converts the output of open-source models into JSON format.
- **Extensible**: Easily adaptable to other models beyond LLAMA.
- **Open-Source**: Contributions and pull requests are welcome!

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cycloarcane/ADAS-LLAMA-JSON.git
cd ADAS-LLAMA-JSON
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the scripts for generating JSON outputs:

1. Modify the configuration files to specify your model details.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The output will be saved in the `output/` directory as a JSON file.
